# M&M Color Sorter

This is a simplified version of this http://www.instructables.com/id/MM-Color-Sorter/. The code and the build are both simplified and made using inexpensive materials. For the complete list see the BOM file.

The functionality is shown in this <insert video> video. This being a streamlined version it sorts only three colors by default: orange, red and yellow, but it can pe adapted for all six of the possible colors. Possible upgrades includes a default recipient for colors with no match and a second sorting sequence for green, blue and brown activated with a simple push button. This project is just a starting point and the code is very easy to read and understand. 
  
Here is the circuit scheme <insert circuit scheme> and a few photos of the "almost finished" build.
